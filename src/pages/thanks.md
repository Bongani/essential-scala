## Thanks #{-}

Many thanks to Richard Dallway and Jonathan Ferguson,
who took on the herculean task of proof reading our early drafts
and helped develop the rendering pipeline that produces the finished book.

Thanks also to Danielle Ashley, who updated all of the code samples
to use [Tut][link-tut] and increased our code quality 100% overnight!

Thanks also to
Amir Aryanpour,
Audrey Welsh,
Daniel Watford,
Jason Scott,
Joe Halliwell,
Jon Pearce,
Konstantine Gadyrka,
N. Sriram,
Rebecca Grenier,
and Raffael Dzikowski,
who sent us corrections and suggestions
while the book was in early access.
Knowing that our work was being used
made the long haul of writing worthwhile.
